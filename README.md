<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the Project

TaskIt was created as the final project of the Ironhack frontend bootcamp. The goal was to create a task web aplication using Vue 3 applying HTML, CSS and JS learnt in the bootcamp. I based the desing on post-it's because I use them in every day life to manage tasks. In addition to the guidelines I added an extra functionality to the app. Creating a dropdown menu which allows users to set a task state. Based on agile, users can select: "Backlog", "To do" or "Doing". The task state conditions the taskIt's color to pink, orange or yellow. 

Here are the guidelines for the final Vue.js project:

- [x] Creation of account: users will be able to register in the application through a Sign Up process, Log In and Log Out.
- [x] Task management: users will be able to create, edit, mark/unmark as completed and delete tasks.
- [x] Data storage: the application will be connected to Supabase and all the information of the tasks and users will be saved on that platform.
- [x] State management: Pinia stores will be used to connect with the backend and control the state of the application.
- [x] Navigation: Vue Router will be used to navigate the page without having to do a refresh.
- [x] Single Style: A single style file (assets/style.css) will be created and correctly inserted into main.js to access the classes and component ids.
- [x] Responsive design: the page will be responsive and will have at least two versions: mobile and desktop.
- [x] Deployment: the application will be deployed in Vercel.
- [x] Handling of asynchronous operations: asynchronous operations will be handled correctly with promises or async/await.
- [x] Documentation: a work path will be maintained in the repository's readme, updating it daily.

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->

## Acknowledgment

I want to thank the three professors of this bootcamp at Ironhack; Diego Zito, Jarko Garrido and Aleix Abuli. Thank you for your time, information, patience and the extra hours to help solve all kinds of doubts. Also, to the SOC for providing me with this course so that I can continue training and growing professionally. To my classmates, thank you for the support and a great time! I would specially like to thank my classmate and friend Laura Anguita for the debugging, laughs and dancing!

## Technical Challenge

- Vue.js -> Understanding the components, where to reference what and how. Using the stores, connecting to supabase. As this was my first priject with vue.js and supabase understanding how everything works and how was a struggle. It took patience, time and support from classmates. 

- CSS flex confusion -> My Task container & wrapper CSS is a mess, I had to patch it up with margins and could not figure out where the issue is or how to fix it. It looks ok but I know it's not... eye twitch...


<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Big Mistake

- JS and Vue glitches -> The biggest mistake was not understanding fully what I was doing and getting desperate, stressed and frustrated. Little by little, with support from teachers and classmates, I was able to understand the code. Managing to add exta functionality to the app with "task status/color". 

- Underestimating CSS -> I thought the worst was over after I got all the functional parts to work and that the design would be easier. It seemed simple enough... before I stated working on it. It took more patience, effort and tirals than the rest. 

- Stress management -> When I got stuck, over glitches and flex, it frustrated me. Which got me obsessed, to the pont where forgot to eat or drink and laughed manically too many times to count.
